# antlr4-vala-runtime
ANTLR4 Runtime for the Vala and Genie languages (and possibly C too!)
This isn't complete yet. I'd appericiate help, especially on the documentation comments and fixing any errors and/or warnings in the code, like converting getter and setter methods to properties and other errors. Email me to ubuntugeek1904@gmail.com if you have any questions!

[What is Vala?](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala)

# What equipment to use with Vala?
I personally use [Gnome Builder](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Builder), but Visual Studio Code works as well. For telemetry-free VSCode, use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/).

For auto-completion (VSCode doesnt have it, and honestly the built-in one in GB is horrible), use [Vala Language Server](https://github.com/benwaffle/vala-language-server). It is available for Vim, GB and VSCode/ium.

Good luck, and I hope this won't segfault :)
